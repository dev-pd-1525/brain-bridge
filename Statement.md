# Project Statement: BRAIN BRIDGE

## 1. Problem Statement 
Many existing educational platforms lack an immediate and streamlined method for teachers to input student scores, quickly analyze class performance metrics (like averages and deviation), and determine enrollment overlaps. This system aims to provide a fast, structured, command-line alternative for these essential academic tasks.

## 2. Scope of the Project 
The project scope is focused on **in-memory data handling and academic computation** within a command-line interface. It includes object-oriented modeling of students, role-based menu access, statistical analysis using external libraries (NumPy), and set theory application to class enrollment. It does **not** include persistent storage (database integration) or a graphical user interface.

## 3. Target Users 
* Teachers/Faculty: Primary users responsible for grade entry, statistical analysis, and viewing class performance.
* Students: Secondary users who can view their individual grades and GPA (placeholder).
* Academic Administrators: Potential users for running class enrollment and combination analysis reports.

## 4. High-Level Features 
1.  Secure, Role-Segregated Login.
2.  CRUD-like operation for student grade records (Create/Update).
3.  Class-wide analytics (Average, Standard Deviation).
4.  Advanced set-based enrollment comparisons.
5.  Combinatorial group generation.
